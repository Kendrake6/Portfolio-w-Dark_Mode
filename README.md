# Changelog 04.08.2020
## Stucture
This project consists of a main index html file which is supposed to serve as the portfolio web-page. 

### Index.html
Index.html uses data theme to determine light and dark mode. First comes the landing page. The second section is the About Me section.
The third section is used to show the project types that I am currently working on. Need to add a "Contact Me" form as well.

### Sass
Sass has been used as the preprocessor for CSS. The usual 7 in 1 SASS architecture has been utilised here. Dark mode variables are present
in "main.scss"

### Assets
Assets include all the png and svg files that have been used.

### Scripts
Scripts contain one script right now for implementing dark mode as well as animations for hamburger and dark mode toggle button. Anime.js has been used as 
the main library for importing animations.
